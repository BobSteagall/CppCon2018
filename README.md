## Overview

This is the repo for my CppCon 2018 talks: 
* Fast Conversion From UTF-8 with C++, DFAs, and SSE Intrinsics
* Fancy Pointers for Fun and Profit

All the code presented here is basically just snapshots; ongoing work will be found in other repos.  For my other C++ work, see my website [The State Machine](https://bobsteagall.com).
